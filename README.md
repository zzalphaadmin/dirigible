Dirigible!!!
============

Dirigible!!! was Natural Alpha Electronics winning entry in the brIGDA 48 hour game making challenge.

# Dirigible!!!

## On-line Version

We have created an HTML5-based simulator of [Dirigible!!!](http://montrose.is/dirigible "Dirigible!!!"), which you can play [here](http://montrose.is/dirigible "Dirigible!!!"). 

### About the On-Line Version

The simulator was created by first writing Javascript versions of the custom 4DGL Picaso processor calls used by the game and then mechanically translating the original 4DGL source-code with a series of regular expressions. Barring very minor timing variations, the simulator should be a completely faithful recreation of the game as experienced by the judges and public during the contest. 

The 3D model presented uses the same 3D parts and art resources (e.g. sideart, control overlay) as were used to print the 3D parts, produce wooden patterns, and stickers used in the actual assembly. Again, it should be close to a faithful adaptation. A gallery of photos of the actual units produced is available [here](http://tbd.com "TBD").

To explore the case, use the left and right arrows that appear when you hover to the left and right of the unit. To play, simply click the unit when it is facing the front. The control keys are w,a,s,d and j or the arrow keys along with z.

## The Software

The software presented here is exactly the same as was on display the day of the contest. Only commentary comments have been added. The translated simulation software has had minor alterations to account for differences between the real and simulated Picaso processor calls, but is otherwise also unaltered.

The software is written in 4DGL, a proprietary language by [4D Systems](http://www.4dsystems.com.au/ "4D Systems") for use in their line of "intelligent display" modules. For licensing reasons, a [4D Workshop](http://www.4dsystems.com.au/product/4D_Workshop_4_IDE/ "4D-Workshop-4-IDE") project file is not included, but the provided plaintext files should be easily copied, pasted, and arranged into a compiling project.

### Code Commentary

A running commentary on the code starts in [game.4dg](http://tbd.com).

## The Hardware

The tabletop is built around 4D System's [uLCD-24PTU](http://www.4dsystems.com.au/product/uLCD_24PTU/ "uLCD-24PTU") "intelligent display" module, in turn built around 4D System's proprietary Picaso processor and graphics controller.
